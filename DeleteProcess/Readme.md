#Folder Delete
This is a PowerShell script that deletes a specified folder from your system.

#Pre-requisites
- Powershell with administrator access.
- VS Code with Powershell extension.

#Process:
- Write a Powershell script in any of the available editors like `notepad`, `notepad++`, or `VS code with Powershell extension`.
- Navigate to the directory where the file is present. for this example, we locate the file `deletefolder.ps1`.
- To find the file go to the directory where the file is present right click on it and select Open with Powershell.
- Run the script with the following command `./deletefolder.ps1`.
- When the folder is deleted it displays `Folder deleted successfully`.
- When you try and run the function again it shows `Folder does not exist`, beacuse the folder is already deleted.
